Very simple powershell script to activate Windows 10.

[Download](https://github.com/VictorXPDE/winactivator/releases/download/v1.0.0/winactivator.ps1)
### Instructions
First, open Powershell as administrator and set the execution policy to `Bypass` if not set already so you can execute the script.
```pwsh
Set-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -Scope CurrentUser
```
Now change the directory to where you downloaded the file and execute the script with `.\winactivator.ps1`.
```pwsh
cd C:\Users\youruser\path-to-file\
.\winactivator.ps1
```
And everything else should be done automatically.
