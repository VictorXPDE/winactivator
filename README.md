### Instructions
First, open Powershell as administrator and set the execution policy to `Bypass` if not set already so you can execute the script.
```pwsh
Set-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -Scope CurrentUser
```
Now change the directory to where you saved the file and execute the script with `.\winactivator.ps1`.
```pwsh
cd C:\Users\youruser\path-to-file\
.\winactivator.ps1
```
And now everything else should be done automatically.
